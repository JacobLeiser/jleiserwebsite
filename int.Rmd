I have a keen interest in TV and film and regularly attend the Glasgow Film Theatre. In October 2018, I had a review of the Netflix series ‘Maniac’ published online by the BPS magazine, ‘The Psychologist’. The review considers the series’ message of the ever-present need for human involvement in therapy despite being set in a fictional world of huge technological and pharmaceutical advancement.

I enjoy keeping fit by going to the gym and playing in a 7-a-side football league with friends from university.

I’m a member of the Glasgow University Charity Fashion Show. We raised £15,000 for the Scottish Association of Mental Health in 2016/17 and £23,000 for Glasgow Children’s Hospital last year. This year we are raising money for Simon Community, which is a charity fighting homelessness in Glasgow.  (photos)
