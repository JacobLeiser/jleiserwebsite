## The Priory Hospital, Glasgow
The Priory is a private mental healthcare centre primarily dealing with addictions, depression, anxiety and eating disorders. It treats 3 main clinical groups. I had a work experience placement there in May 2016 for a month and from that was employed as a Research Assistant and joined the bank as a Healthcare Assistant. 

#### Work Experience
I had a self-arranged work placement for a month in May '16. This consisted of observing the addiction treatment programme therapy groups. Seeing the different approaches of the therapists and how the varying styles were effective for different types of patients was interesting. 

#### Healthcare Assistant
After my work placement ended, I joined the bank as a Healthcare Assistant. 

#### Research Assistant
I also do data collection for an NHS Tayside study looking at the risk factors for alcoholism.
